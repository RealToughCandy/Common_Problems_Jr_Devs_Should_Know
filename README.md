# Common_Problems_Jr_Devs_Should_Know
A collection of problems submitted by hiring managers, interviewers, and mid &amp; senior level developers they consider mandatory knowledge for junior software developers. 

The purpose of this repo is two-fold. 

##One, to illustrate the expectations of employers and those invovled in the hiring process. 

##Two, to help prepare aspiring and junior developers for a job in software. 

Please provide context when you submit a problem. For example, is the question/challenge geared towards all junior devs, or targeted at a specific skillset (i.e. frontend, backend)?
