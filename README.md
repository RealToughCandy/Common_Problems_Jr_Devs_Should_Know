# Common_Problems_Jr_Devs_Should_Know

A collection of problems & concepts junior developers should know (and be able to solve!), according to people in charge.

These problems have been submitted by:

- hiring managers
- interviewers
- mid- and senior-level developers 

Purpose of this project: 

### One: share employer & co-worker expectations.

### Two: help prepare aspiring and junior developers for a job in software. 

***

## Talk about your experience with Git.
Often I come across projects where I need to hire a couple of additional developers. Knowledge of, and especially experience with Git is very important!
