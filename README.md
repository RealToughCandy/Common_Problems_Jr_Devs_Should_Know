# Common_Problems_Jr_Devs_Should_Know
A collection of problems submitted by hiring managers, interviewers, and mid &amp; senior level developers they consider mandatory knowledge for all junior software developers. 

The purpose of this repo is two-fold. 

## One, to illustrate the expectations of employers, those involved in the hiring process, and those who supervise juniors. 

## Two, to help prepare aspiring and junior developers for a job in software. 

## Talk about your experience with Git.
Often I come across projects where I need to hire a couple of additional developers. Knowledge of, and especially experience with Git is very important!
